# Second serie of the JavaScript for the Web Exercises

## HTTP requests

Some of these exercises will ask you to perform HTTP Request. It is recommended to use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). To do so you can install it with:

```bash
npm install --save axios
```

Then to import it:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
```

Using axios it is strongly recommended to use the [async/await](https://javascript.info/async-await) syntax when working with asynchronous operations.

To test APIs rapidly before coding you should use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

## 2.1 - Improved cat cycler

Exactly the same exercise than the cat cycler in the first serie, you can even re-use your code. Except now you can't use your collection of cat images any more and must use the [random.cat API](https://aws.random.cat/meow).

## 2.2 - Beer displayer

Use the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to make an application that displays beers. For each beer it should display its name, tagline, its year of first brewery and its image.

Each beer should be presented in a rectangle and multiple rectangles should be shown on the same line. The application should be responsive.

*Hey, while you're at it you could take a look at [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) which is already included in the exercise theme. Maybe it contains useful tools to help present all that...*

## 2.3 - Cookie Clicker

Create a clone of [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/).

It should display nicely at every step of the creation.

### 2.3.1 - Base Game

Create a cookie button and a cookie counter. When you click on the cookie it should increment the counter.

The cookie button must use the same image than the one used in the official game. *You have to steal that image from the offical game.*

### 2.3.2 - Animation

Add a "bump" animation why you click on the cookie.

### 2.3.3 - Multiplier

When you reach 50 cookies add a button allowing to buy a multiplier. When you have one multiplier each click on the cookie will earn you 2 cookies. When you have two multipliers it will become 4, etc...

The price of the multiplier is multiplied by 1.5 each time you buy it.

### 2.3.4 - Autoclicker

When you reach 100 cookies add a button allowing to buy an autoclicker. The autoclicker will automatically click on the cookie every 0.1 seconds.

The price of the autoclicker is multiplied by 1.5 each time you buy it.

### 2.3.5 - Facebook share

Add a facebook button to share a message on Facebook saying "I collected x cookies with my Becode Cookie Clicker!".
